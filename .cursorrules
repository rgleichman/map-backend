Please always reference the project guidelines in AGENTS.md when working on this Phoenix application. Follow all the guidelines specified there, including:

- Phoenix v1.8 guidelines (LiveView templates, layouts, authentication)
- Elixir best practices (list access, variable binding, etc.)
- Ecto guidelines (preloading associations, changesets)
- Phoenix HTML/HEEx guidelines (templates, forms, components)
- LiveView guidelines (streams, testing, form handling)
- Authentication flow and routing guidelines
- React + TypeScript guidelines for frontend components
- Hybrid architecture patterns (LiveView + React)

Always follow the specific patterns and conventions outlined in AGENTS.md.

## Frontend Architecture Notes

This application uses a hybrid approach:
- **Phoenix LiveView** for most pages (auth, settings, forms)
- **React + TypeScript** for complex interactive pages (map interface)

When working on React components:
- Use TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Follow Tailwind CSS guidelines (no inline styles)
- Mount React conditionally via `#react-root` div
- Pass props via `data-*` attributes
- Use existing API endpoints, don't duplicate backend logic
- Handle authentication properly (check `is_owner` flags)
- Structure code modularly: `components/`, `api/`, `types.ts`

This application targets both mobile web and desktop web.
